# Algorithm Visualizer (Java)
A Java Swing-based application that visualizes classic algorithms with step-by-step tracing and clear explanations.

## Features
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (with sorted-array validation)
- Bubble Sort (early-exit optimization)
- Selection Sort
- Step-by-step animation and manual stepping
- Operation counters (comparisons, swaps)
- Time & Space complexity display
- Custom array input support

## Technologies
- Java
- Swing (GUI)
- Git & GitHub

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Eclipse
3. Run `Main.java`

## Learning Goals
This project was built by me to improve algorithmic reasoning, explainability, and understanding of time and space complexity. Not only does it help in visualising it works as a cheat sheet for me while revising
the concepts.
